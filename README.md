A busy-wait loop to more aggressively target the 1ms delay between attempts. However, it's important to reiterate that achieving precise timing for operations involving network communication and external processing (like an SSH handshake) is highly variable and not guaranteed. This approach also increases CPU usage due to the busy-wait loop.

Remember, running brute-force attacks without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the necessary authorizations before proceeding with such actions.
